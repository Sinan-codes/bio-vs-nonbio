# Biodegradable vs Non-Biodegradable Image Classifier

This project aims to automate the classification of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories using deep learning models. Manual waste sorting is inefficient and error-prone, especially in developing countries. Automating this process can improve recycling, reduce landfill usage, and promote sustainable practices.
